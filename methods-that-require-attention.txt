The following methods require attention from Thomas and Stefan

Package.hpp: makeDDNode
    Please read this method and verify whether things more or less make sense

Package.hpp: normalizeLIMDD()
    0. please read this method and verify whether things more or less make sense
    1. two LIMs are multiplied in the following line in Step 1,
            r.p->e[1].l = LimEntry<>::multiply(lowLim, higLim);
       This may introduce a memory leak; ideally, these LIMs are put in the table
       The same question for LimEntry<>::multiply in Step 5 and Step 7
    2. in Step 3, the procedure highLabelZ may change the weight on the high edge, by multiplying it by -1.
       Is this a violation of the normalization rules?
    3. In Step 6, the root edge weight is multiplied by -1.
       Can this have unintended consequences if the same weights are used elsewhere in the diagram?

PauliAlgebra.hpp: implement several algorithms without a memory leak:
    - GramSchmidt
        Can be implemented with almost no reallocation of memory
        e.g., the 'y' object can be a local variable, instead of a pointer
    - GaussianElimination(LimEntry)
       the following line may introduce a memory leak, by allocating a new LimEntry without deallocating the previous content of G[reduceColId]
        G[reduceColId] = LimEntry<NUM_QUBITS>::multiply(G[reduceColId], G[reducingColId]);
    - GaussianEliminationModuloPhase
       the same as above
    - GaussianElimination(LimBitset)
       the same as above
    - almost any place where two LIMs are multiplied
    
PauliAlgebra.hpp: highLabelZWeight
    Here a weight is multiplied by -1, in the function
            weight.multiplyByMinusOne();
    Can this have unintended consequences if the CTEntry is also used by another weight elsewhere in the diagram?
    If so, we should refactor this line to have no unintended consequences

PauliAlgebra.hpp: constuctStabilizerGeneratorSetZ
    deallocate 'm' and 'minus'

PauliAlgebra.hpp: pruneZeroColumns
    This procedure removes LimEntry* pointers from a vector, without properly deallocating the LimEntry objects
    this procedure should reduce the refcount of the LimEntry objects it removes from G

PauliAlgebra.hpp: appendIdentityMatrixBitset
    allocates new LimBitset, but these objects are never deallocated.
    Solution: deallocate immediately after use, since they are temporary objects used locally in a function

PauliAlgebra.hpp: getKernelZ
    This procedure allocates LimBitset objects in the G_Id variable,
    but these objects are not deallocated.

in PauliAlgebra.hpp: getCosetIntersectionElementPauli
    The following local variables are allocated on the heap but not deallocated, causing memory leaks:
        GH
        GH_Id
        a_H
        a_prime
        k_G
        k_H

PauliAlgebra.hpp: constructStabilizerGeneratorSetZ
    put LimEntry pointers 'idZ' and 'minusIdZ' into the LimTable?
    deallocate 'minus' and 'm'

PauliAlgebra.hpp: isTimesMinusOne
    Should this method be moved to Complex.hpp?

PauliAlgebra.hpp: getIsomorphismZ
    'isoHigh' is allocated, but not deallocated.
    Put this object in the LimTable, or deallocate appropriately in some other way, e.g.,
    refactor into a local variable (on the stack)

PauliAlgebra.hpp: highLabelZ
    GH is not deallocated properly

in LimTable.hpp: LimEntry::multiply
    put the new LimEntry in the LimTable?
    otherwise, in the places that call this function, make sure that the LimEntry is put in the LimTable?
